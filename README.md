LK Demo: OpenCV C++ to WebAssembly

Overview

This project demonstrates the power of WebAssembly (WASM) by porting the OpenCV C++ LK (Lucas-Kanade) optical flow demo to run in web browsers. With the invaluable support of generative AI, we've achieved performance levels that rival native applications, all within a browser environment.

Key Features

Browser-based Performance: Experience desktop-like speed and responsiveness directly in your web browser.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: One binary runs seamlessly across all major operating systems, eliminating the need for platform-specific ports.
Mobile Support: Fully functional on tablets, including iPads, allowing point tracking with touch input.

Why It Matters
Traditionally, porting applications to different operating systems like Windows or macOS required significant effort. This WebAssembly implementation demonstrates how a single binary can now run efficiently across all major platforms, streamlining development and distribution processes.

Try It Out
Click on any point in the demo to see real-time tracking in action. Whether you're on a desktop, laptop, or even an iPad, you'll be amazed at the smooth performance and accuracy of the point tracking.
